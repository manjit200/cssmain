<body bgcolor="pink" <p><i> Today I am going to tell you what me and my family call the “Candy Shop Story.” <br> So, this story takes place at a mall on April 8th,2011.<br>
     It was my birthday and my all time favorite place to go as a kid was the Colorado Mills mall.  <br For my birthday my parents took me we spent basically all day there,
      just shopping around just for me.</i> </p>
