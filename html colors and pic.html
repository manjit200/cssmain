 <abbr title=" Sapling of the oldest educational organization of Hoshiarpur Shri Sanatan Dharm Sabha (Regd.)
 , which was planted in 1890 with a view of providing education based on Indian Culture on one hand and to safeguard the Indian traditions on the other has now turned into a huge tree.
  The Sabha is, at present, running a Sanskrit College and two Senior Sec. Schools, one each for (Boys and Girls). The credit for all this goes to our great predecessors, patrons, mentors, philanthropists of the area.
